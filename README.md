# TextAdventure
Barren Moore
Description

Simple text adventure called "The adventure of the barren moor"

In "The adventure of the barren moor" the player is in the middle of an infinite grey swamp. This grey swamp has few distinguishing characteristics, other than the fact that it is large and infinite and dreary. However, the player DOES have a magic compass that tells the player how far away the next feature of interest is.

The player can go north,south,east,or west.

Here is an example playthrough you might create

    

    You awaken to find yourself in a barren moor.  Try "look"

    > look

    Grey foggy clouds float oppressively close to you,

    reflected in the murky grey water which reaches up your shins.

    Some black plants barely poke out of the shallow water.

    Try "north","south","east",or "west"

    You notice a small watch-like device in your left hand. 

    It has hands like a watch, but the hands don't seem to tell time.

     

    The dial reads '5m'

    >north

    The dial reads '4.472m'

    >north

    The dial reads '1m'

    >e

     

    You see a box sitting on the plain.   Its filled with treasure!  You win!  The end.


​This exercise must be submitted via a github repository (Purely dedicated for it)

There are a few stages to be implemented in this project

    ​Basic game functionality, moving a player around
    Win condition (Getting to the final point, or whatever you decide is most appropriate)
    Enemies 
    Multiple artifacts (Power ups and the like)

You will be developing on the developer branch of your repository.
You should only merge to master each time you have achieved a significant amount of functionality (e.g. as previously stated)
The master branch should always be a working copy.

Your code will be graded on the following criteria (In order of priority)

    ​​Re-usability (Lack of code duplication)
    Readability
    Scalability
    Functionality


Good luck, have fun!
